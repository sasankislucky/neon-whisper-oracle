it is a AI interface like a app which we can use to communicate using source base like if you need to use it you don't need to compile it I created because why not and it is not a professional project it is just a small unwanted shit if you like to test and you want to do whatever you like to do it yourself 
This project is built with:

- Vite
- TypeScript
- React
- shadcn-ui
- Tailwind CSS
and it was created by me V.Seshank babu don't mind me if anything fail check every line of script find it fixed because number one you can know how internal code and script work number two you can use this from your educational purposes and your learning purposes because it is a interpreted source based project thank you so much love you all
install dependency using npm install or pnpm install or yarn install and do it yourself create it like as you like not for companies use your developers to create  from open source numbers and individuals and everyone rather than companies you can create and you can use your repositories to publish new version especially not for companies to create and publish it for your own benefit it is a open source not for close source members
