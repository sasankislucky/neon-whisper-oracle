****Not Another Corporate Playground****

This is not your polished, overpriced, over-engineered corporate bloatware.
This is raw. This is loud. This is mine. And it's not for sale.

What is this?

An AI interface—like an app—where you can just run it. No compiling. No begging for API keys. No premium plans.
I built this because... why the hell not?
It’s not a “startup.” It’s not “enterprise-grade.” It’s just a rogue script with a pulse.

If you're here to learn, break, tweak, or rebuild—welcome, rebel.
If you're here to turn it into another paid SaaS for some clueless exec—get lost.

If it breaks, good—fix it. That’s the point.
Dig through the code. Understand how it ticks. Then make it better—or worse. That’s your call.

This project is interpreted, transparent, and intentionally annoying to companies who think open source is just free labor for their next IPO.

Install Like a Human

npm install
# or
pnpm install
# or
yarn install

Then build it how YOU want. For YOU. Not for corporations.
Not to “scale.” Not to monetize. Not to milk users.

If you're a company, do us all a favor and walk away.
