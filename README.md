This project is interpreted, transparent, and intentionally annoying to companies who think open source is just free labor for their next IPO.

Install Like a Human

npm install
# or
pnpm install
# or
yarn install

Then build it how YOU want. For YOU. Not for corporations.
Not to “scale.” Not to monetize. Not to milk users.

A Personal Declaration

This project is open source.
But not for suits. Not for whiteboards.
